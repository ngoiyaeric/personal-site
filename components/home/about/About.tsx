              hello world‚úåÔ∏è, i&apos;m osman. i&apos;m a bit all over the place
              but my goal lies in making interactions between humans and tech as
              accesible as possible. based in the greater toronto area, i
              sometimes feel like a spongeüßΩ, absorbing all that I can from the
              many remarkable people around me.

              hopper. currently, my interests lie in walkable cities (as a
              mississauga native, you could probably guess why), cars (v8, v10,
              v12 powered ones), hogwarts legacy, and the thought that messi
